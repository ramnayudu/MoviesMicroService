Welcome to the MoviesMicroService wiki!

Architecture - ReactWebapp -> APIM -> Azure Functions (MicroServices) -> Azure Cosmos DB
 
Steps 
1.Run the Backend MoviesMicroService  separately 

2.Run the frontend folder separately (npm install -> npm run start) (no need to run the bakend as i used deployed urls of APIM )

3. Seacrh and Filter option are there on top of the screen 

Note:
1. Used Azure Functions, Azure APIM, Azure Cosmos DB as infra resources 
2. Faced a couple of issues while mocking in unit tests and not able to complete the UI tests in the specified time
